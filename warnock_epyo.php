					<p class="bg">John Edward Warnock (born October 6, 1940) is an American computer scientist and businessman best known as the co-founder with Charles Geschke of Adobe Systems Inc., the graphics and publishing software company. Warnock was President of Adobe for his first two years and chairman and CEO for his remaining sixteen years at the company. Although retired as CEO in 2000, he still co-chairs the board with Geschke. Warnock has pioneered the development of graphics, publishing, Web and electronic document technologies that have revolutionized the field of publishing and visual communications.</p>

			<section>
				<h3 class="header">Early Life and Education</h3>
				<p>Warnock was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. He failed mathematics in ninth grade but graduated from Olympus High School in 1958. Warnock has a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and philosophy, a Doctor of Philosophy degree in electrical engineering (computer science), and an honorary degree in science, all from the University of Utah. At the University of Utah he was a member of the Gamma Beta Chapter of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He also has an honorary degree from the American Film Institute.</p>

				<h3 class="header">Current Life</h3>
				<p>He currently lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. He is married to Marva E. Warnock, illustrator, and has three children. A strong supporter of higher education, Warnock and his wife, Marva, have supported three presidential endowed chairs in computer science, mathematics and fine arts at the University of Utah and also an endowed chair in medical research at Stanford University.<br><br> The Warnocks, who have a home in Deer Valley, still hit the slopes for skiing every winter. And they own the celebrated Blue Boar Inn in Midway, which also keeps them busy in Utah. It's been nearly a half-century since John Warnock spent that summer recapping tires. Thirty years after founding Adobe, he shrugs off his success and offers up one of his characteristic understatements: "We sort of learned as we went. And it turned out all right." <br><br>Hobbies include photography, skiing, Web development, painting, hiking, curation of rare scientific books and historical Native American objects. Over the years, he and Marva would often travel to the Four Corners region with their three children to visit Native American sites, and the trips sparked an interest in American Indian art and culture. "We started collecting casually, maybe 10 or 12 years ago," he says. "We think the early history of the United States is interesting, and the art produced by Native Americans is incredible." The Warnocks' collection began with baskets and pots and has since grown to include hundreds of items, including moccasins, shirts, and beadwork, from more than two dozen Native American tribes. The collection has toured the country in many exhibits, including one at the University of Utah in 2010, and a number of the pieces may end up going to Paris for an exhibit in 2014. The Warnocks also have devoted attention to their home state in other ways.</p>

				<h2 class="header">Career</h2>
				<p>Warnock's earliest publication and subject of his master's thesis, was his 1964 proof of a theorem solving the Jacobson radical for row-finite matrices, which was originally posed by the American mathematician Nathan Jacobson in 1956.<br><br>In his 1969 doctoral thesis, Warnock invented the Warnock algorithm for hidden surface determination in computer graphics. It works by recursive subdivision of a scene until areas are obtained that are trivial to compute. It solves the problem of rendering a complicated image by avoiding the problem. If the scene is simple enough to compute then it is rendered; otherwise it is divided into smaller parts and the process is repeated. Warnock notes that for this work he received "the dubious distinction of having written the shortest doctoral thesis in University of Utah history".<br><br>In 1976, while Warnock worked at Evans &amp; Sutherland, a Salt Lake City-based computer graphics company, the concepts of the PostScript language were seeded. Prior to co-founding Adobe, with Geschke and Putman, Warnock worked with Geschke at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC), where he had started in 1978. Unable to convince Xerox management of the approach to commercialize the InterPress graphics language for controlling printing, he, together with Geschke and Putman, left Xerox to start Adobe in 1982. At their new company, they developed an equivalent technology, PostScript, from scratch, and brought it to market for Apple's LaserWriter in 1985.<br><br>In the Spring of 1991, Warnock outlined a system called "Camelot", that evolved into the Portable Document Format (PDF) file-format. The goal of Camelot was to "effectively capture documents from any application, send electronic versions of these documents anywhere, and view and print these documents on any machines". Warnock's document contemplated, "Imagine if the IPS (Interchange PostScript) viewer is also equipped with text searching capabilities. In this case the user could find all documents that contain a certain word or phrase, and then view that word or phrase in context within the document. Entire libraries could be archived in electronic form..."<br><br>One of Adobe's popular typefaces, Warnock, is named after him.<br><br>Adobe's PostScript technology made it easier to print text and images from a computer, revolutionizing media and publishing in the 1980s.</p>

				<h2 class="header">Post Career Works</h2>
				<p>In 2003 Warnock and his wife donated 200,000 shares of Adobe Systems valued at over $5.7 million to the University of Utah as the main gift for a new engineering building.In 2003, the couple announced a major donation to the University of Utah, providing the funds to kickstart construction on the John E. and Marva M. Warnock Engineering Building. The 100,000-square-foot structure was completed in 2007 and provides some of the most advanced engineering classrooms and facilities in the country.<br><br> Dr. Warnock holds seven patents. In addition to Adobe Systems, he serves or has served on:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>The Board of Directors</strong> at: ebrary, Knight-Ridder, MongoNet, Netscape Communications, Salon Media Group</li>
					<li><strong>Chairman</strong> of the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose</li>
					<li><strong>The Board of Trustees</strong> of the American Film Institute and the Sundance Institute</li>
				</ol>
				<p>These days, Warnock devotes much of his time to his other interests. He began collecting rare books in 1986, starting with the purchase of a 1570 edition of Euclid's <em>Elements</em> from a bookstore in London. In 1995, he started a company called Octavo. The idea of the company was to sell CDs with high-resolution scans of the books. "We scanned some of the great books from the greatest libraries in the world, as well as a lot of the books I own," he says. "The company was not successful for a number of reasons, but I had all the book files." So he created the website <em>rarebookroom.org</em> to showcase the scanned images and make these rare books readily available to anyone with a computer and Internet access. The site now features more than 400 volumes.</p>

			<h2 class="header">Charity Works with Adobe</h2>
			<p class="bg">Community giving has been a core value at Adobe since the company was founded in 1982. For more than 25 years they've built upon the philanthropic commitment established by Adobe cofounders John Warnock and Chuck Geschke, who believed in the fundamental importance of giving back to the communities in which they live and work.<br><br>Over time, the philanthropy and community involvement programs at Adobe have expanded dramatically. In the early years of the company, Adobe established a philanthropy council to manage the administration of small grants and to help determine where they should be giving. The philanthropy council also worked to promote and implement Adobe-sponsored volunteer projects that encouraged meaningful involvement for employees in their local communities. <br><br>In the 1990s, Adobe community programs grew to include matching gifts, product donations, and corporate funding (with grants typically ranging from US$1,000 to US$10,000). In the meantime, the dedicated efforts of employees in Adobe volunteer projects far surpassed the original philanthropy council's expectations.<br><br>"Over the years, whenever there has been a call for action, Adobe employees have come through," says Paul Cohen, supplier manager in Global Supply Chain Manufacturing at Adobe. Paul, who has been active in the San Jose volunteer group for 11 years, remembers many occasions when Adobe employees made remarkable contributions.<br><br>"Many years back, just after the dot-com bust when the Silicon Valley economy was in poor shape, the local food bank was overwhelmed. A day or two before Thanksgiving, it put out a desperate call for help. They sent out an e-mail message to employees, and within two or three hours the Adobe service center had received US$2,500 and 50 turkeys."

				<h2 class="header">Charity Works Continued...</h2>
				<p class="bg">"Again, after the devastating tsunami in 2005, employees came through with strong support," he recalls. "The bottom line is that Adobe employees respond when help is needed."<br><br>In 2006, Adobe successfully launched its global signature philanthropy program, Adobe Youth Voices (AYV), which provides the technology, tools, and training to enable underserved youth in middle school and high school to explore and comment on their world through multimedia. Beyond the AYV program, the Adobe community involvement team also manages Adobe Community Investment Grants, Adobe Action Grants, matching grants, software donations, sponsorships, and employee volunteerism.<br><br>In 2007, Adobe donated over US$25.4 million in cash and software to thousands of K-12 schools, nonprofit organizations, and universities throughout the world, and the company was ranked second on the Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal's Top Corporate Philanthropist List. On a national level, Adobe was ranked 22nd on the 100 Best Corporate Citizens 2007 list, researched and compiled by Business Ethics magazine.<br><br>Adobe's work in the community will only continue to grow in the next 25 years. Through thoughtful contributions of time, funding, resources, and support, Adobe and its employees are committed to continuing to make a positive impact on the communities where they live, work, and do business.</p>
